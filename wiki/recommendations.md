# Client recommendations

## Task list in which the task should be created
All recommendations must be raised in the 'Recommendations' task list
  
## Raising a recommendation
Recommendations can be raised in 2 different ways depending on what you are recommending:
1. [Repeat recommendations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PvYKQiEU02H4BaQjbl-iCycD_7B7_5mcs9gk_01EGdc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) are recommendations that could be sent out to multiple clients 
2. Bespoke recommendations - are project specific 

**Repeat recommendations**
Process - TBC
Which task list do they go into? 

**Bespoke resommendations**
If the recommendation is specific to a client and it doesnt come under any of our blanket recommendations you should create a new task. It is important to follow these guidelines:

- Raise the task in the 'Recommendations' task list
- Provide a clear and concise task description so the client understands what we are suggesting, including, What, why, Who and how long it will take and add your estimation to the task
- Do not assign the task to anybody
- Do not move the task from the task list
- Do not work on the task until it is in your workload

## Automations & Triggers when a recommendation is created
When created in the 'Recommendations' task list a 'Recommendation' tag is automatically added and Suzanne Moss and the Product Owner are added as a follower (task list default).

## When the client accepts the recommendation
1. Suzanne Moss will receive a notification of the task comment
2. Reassign the task to the relevant assignee (detailed in the task description)
3. Acknowledges the client's acceptance
4. Hi [Name],
5. Thank you for accepting this recommendation. We will discuss the scheduling of this work during our next call.
6. Thanks
7. [Name]
8. Move the task to the Prioritise column


## When the client declines the recommendation
1. Suzanne will be notified of the comment
2. Acknowledge the clients comment
Hi [Name]
Thank you for letting us know that this recommendation isnt of interest to you. We will close the task.
[Name]

## If the client hasnt responded after 1 month - TW Automation
1. An automation will post the following comment on any task with a recommendation tag, which has been inactive for 30 days...
2. "Please could you let us know if this is something that you would like us to schedule in? "

3. ## If the client hasnt responded after 2 months - TW Automation
4. An automation will post the following comment and close any task with a recommendation tag, which has been inactive for 60 days...
2. "As this recommendation is 60+ days old we assume that isnt of interest at the moment. It is also potentially out of date due to the time that has passed since we recommended the work, so will go ahead and close this task. 
If you would like us to raise an upto date recommendation for this then please let us know."

# CURRENTLY IN TESTING UNDER MC MASTER PROJECT
The automations have been changed to test this:
Recommendation inactive 1 day
Recommendation inactive 2 days
