## Aplicabality
This recommendation is applicable for all M2 sites not using MDOQ hosting.

## Pitch
Elasticsearch is a service installed on your webserver that gives fast and accurate responses to user searches, as well as which products are in which categories.
It is essential to keep this service up to date and inline with minimum requirements for your Magento 2 version. (Different Magento versions require different versions of Elasticsearch)
We have found that a newer version is available and are recommending that we upgrade this service.
Because you aren't on MDOQ hosting this task will require collaboration from your hosting provider. (We will guide you through all communication necessary for a successful upgrade).


## Process
### Who
Anyone with access to MDOQ
