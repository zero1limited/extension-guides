# Asynchronous Email sending


## Pitch

In recent months we have seen a significant number of email transport issues which in certain situations can cause issues with checkout. For instance, if your Magento installation is attempting to relay emails via SMTP, and (for whatever reason) this is not working, this can cause the checkout to stop working completely. Furthermore S1 investigations like this can often consume excessive retainer hours as this is often difficult to diagnose therefore business impact is high.

We have found no reason why the configuration setting for Asynchronous Email sending should not be turned on. This detatches the email transport from the checkout process and assigns the outbound transactional emails to a queue which are subsequently picked up by background processes (cron). As part of this work we also bake/lock this configuration setting into code which further aids the support process and prevents change. 


## Instructions

When your MDOQ instance is created, run this commands and then push your changes to Git.

```
bin/magento config:set --lock-config sales_email/general/async_sending 1
```

Since this changes the application configuration this is NOT a ZERO-DOWNTIME deployment, assign to QA for an early morning release.
