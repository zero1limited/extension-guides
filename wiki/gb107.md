# Initial Notes

## Pitch

We can provision a dedicated server with Magento 2.2.x, installed and fully functional, ready to bind into a Git Repo if this is to be used by a client. Clients will have to pay extra for this service but we could effectively provide it for maybe 2 days labour?



Create a server on OHV and define the startup script

We do not need varnish in this setup.
