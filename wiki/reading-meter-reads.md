Reading Meters

On the last day of every month or as near to there as possible, we need to submit a meter reading to our utilities provider - As of June 2025 our providers are British Gas

The key for cupboard that has the electricity meter in is in a key box tin located in a set of draws to the side of Suzannes desk

The meter cupboard is located outside of the office in the corridor opposite the ladies toilets

Ensure you are reading the meter box with Suite 1 labelled on it
