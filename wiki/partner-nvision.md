Hi Arron,
 
Sorry, now I was the one delaying the conversation.
Below is the email I had open as a draft.. But then we suddenly had some pretty bad family news, which put my work life on hold for some time.
 
Now I’m back on track, and ready to start doing some work with you.
 
As you can see below, in what I wanted to write you earlier, we made a good start in the UK. So let’s make use of that. And today I got some information from an existing client looking to move. I briefly spoke about it with Willem (Hyva), and then again, your name popped up.
 
My ideas on how to move forward:
Let have another call next week. At first, just get back in touch, because it’s been a bit too long already.
But then lets discus:
That existing client.
Doing another proper demo for people on your team.
Your ICP.
How to get started with marketing, potentially with:
Announcement on Linkedin.
Content for you to use (website/social/etc)
Content we could use to inspire our BC partners
Other types of material we/you could use
Webinar on MS Dynamics + Miami?
 
And please let me know what you want to add to the list.

I’m back in the office. As mentioned below, I first had to visit some of our UK ERP partners. (And afterwards, I was on vacation :).
One of the things we did was promoting Magento at a big ERP event: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tysvdheuvel_userday2025-techfest-innovationhighlights-activity-7323683859219308544-aBIW/
This was quite a big success. So, it looks like we’re starting to make waves among UK MS Dynamics users with our Magento-integrated solution.
 
Kind regards, met vriendelijke groet,
Tys van den Heuvel
