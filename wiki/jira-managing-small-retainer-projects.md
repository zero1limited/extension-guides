# 10 hour retainer clients
For smaller retainer customers like this — where expectations are high, but the budget is limited, the goal is clear structure, strict boundaries, and automated transparency.

## What do these customers want to know:
- What will be done
- When it will be done
- How much time they have left in their budget

## Providing Clear structure
I propose we have a confluence doc for every 10 hr retainer clearly detailing the following: 
- Your monthly allocation (e.g.10 hours on the First Monday of each month)
- A table displaying the last 3 months of their budget (inc current month)
- A table showing their backlog, displayed in order of 'business impact and date requested (Urgency top to bottom). They can then get an idea of what will be actioned next. We could asterisk this with 
* Any 'critical requests' submitted via your portal or by email will be actioned immediately using time from your remaining budget, which may delay the delivery of work from your backlog.
** If you wish to change the business impact of any of the tasks in this table please comment 'High/Medium/low (Urgency can only be changed for tasks that have not yet been started)
*** ZER0-1 reserves the right to add any tasks to the top of this list that they deem as urgent.
- What we consider to be a 'critical request'
- What we expect from them....be available on that day to answer any questions our team may have to avoid any blockers

## Requests
- We add this field'(High/Medium/low) non critical request forms, **but** we add a description to this form field 'On your monthly allocated development day, we will select work in order of priority and date of submission - See your confluence document for details'.
- We edit the customer notification sent when a task is created to say "Thanks for your request, it has been added to your backlog and will be reviewed in due course. Your confluence document will display where is positioned in the work queue.
- We could even add a notification to the clients to confirm work has started on task xxx when it moves to in progress and another notification once a task is resolved.
