# NEEDS DISCUSSION 

- [ ] What triggers the Account Manager? - I have updated the project Health settings in TW to reflect the above. Unfortunately Project health isnt a trigger for automations so we need another way to alert Suz and Arron when project health goes into 100+/- and 200+/-
- [ ] Maintenance windows. Morplan now have an event in the calander stating when then maintenance window is open. Can we define a process that can be rolled out? 

- [ ] Clients pressing for work when not scheduled - see example https://zero1hq.slack.com/archives/C1T416XJ6/p1722243461154349
- [ ] Who manages the delivery dates on tasks? Dev team or PM?

# TO ACTION         				
- [ ] Suz - update the staff guide to include looking at project updates
- [ ] Suz - investigate industry standard practice for release maintenance windows - Morplan now have an event in the calander stating when then maintenance window is open
- [ ] Arron - Get project update script running daily

## Summary of service
Projects quoted (PQ) - Projects with a set cost, production and delivery schedule

## Project Manager responsibilities


## Onboarding

**Project initiation**
You will receive an email from Pandadoc notifying you that a contract has been signed by all parties, this is the prompt for you to create a new Project in Teamwork using the key information from the contract.

**Creating the project**
The Account Manager (or person who created the proposal may have already created the project and imported all tasks already, so check whether this is the case before creating a new project. 

- Go to Teamwork > Projects > Template > Select 'PQ' template > Click on 'Use template

- Check, or add the task estimations
- Sense check the tasks against the contract wording and the pricing deck to make sure there are no tasks missing (read the fine print, as attention to detail is key to limiting risks later)
- Sense check that the estimations match the contract and pricing deck. If they don't match you need to identify the reason and discuss this with the Account Manager who quoted the work.

**Create the milestones**
The account manager may have already created the milestones. If not...
- Set up project Milestones as per the pricing deck (or ask the Account Manager to provide these). Each task list should have a corresponding milestone, you need to attach the relevant task list to each milestone
- The contract details how many weeks the project is expected to take. You need to set this date as the due date for all milestones and choose the option to update the dates of the tasks in the attached task list with this date

## Project timeline planning
- Allocate the tasks to the relevant team members
- Double check the start and due dates of the tasks in each list to ensure they marry up with their milestone dates
- Each assignee should have a set number of days per week to work on the project to allow them to carry out other work and avoid any dependencies causing a problem with the schedule. To schedule the resource you need to:
1. Calculate the total number of estimated hours assigned to each team member on the project
2. Make a note of the project start date, due date and the number of weeks the project is expected to take
3. For each assignee you need to look at Teamwork > Schedule to see how many weeks each assignee is available through the course of the project (they may have annual leave booked, or be committed to another project. Make a note of how many weeks they are available
4. Calculate how many days per week you need to allocate each resource to the project. Example: If assignee X has 112 hours of work and the project is expected to take 16 weeks (112/16 = 7 hours) you will need to allocate that persons resource at 1 day per week for the duration of the project. If the assignee has 112 hours but has 2 weeks holiday leave, or other comittments, you need to calculate 112/14 weeks.
5. To allocate the resource go to Teamwrok >Schedule > Allocate time > Select the project > Select Assignee > Add start date (mon) and end date (Fri) and total time of 7 hours. It will automatically calculate the daily effort required, but for our purposes, the staff member is allocated to one day a week (the assignee will manage their own time). Repeat this step for every week of the project and for each assignee.
6. Go to the Project Slack channel and inform the team and Arron of the weekly allocation for each assignee 


# General Management

## Daily checks

- Check Teamwork > Activity and scan through to see if there is anything you need to be aware of.
- Check Teamwork > Everything > Tasks > Filter for tag 'New'. You are looking for any urgent requests that may have come in, but havent yet been reviewed.
- Check Teamwork > Planner > Workload to ensure the workload is looking ok and nobody is overscheduled. You can also see any gaps in the schedule that could be filled on the fly.
-  Check Planner > Workload Look for any late tasks. The team should be managing their own workload and should be adjusting the client's expectations on work delivery and adjusting their task due dates accordingly. This can throw out the schedule so you may need to make some adjustments.
-  heck Planner > Workload Look for any impeded tasks. Is there anything that has become stagnant, or that you can assist with? 
-  Check Teamwork > Everything > comments > Filtered to show any comments you have been notified of
-  Check emails
-  Check milestones
-  Listen to voicemail
  
## Scheduling resources
We plan resources at a high level, allocating a set number of days per week to a project. 

**Teamwork Calendar**
Resource planning is done in the Teamwork Calendar using the following instructions: 

- Click 'Add event'
- Name the event eg 'PADDOCKS - Hyva kickstart'
- Select the Time and or date required for the allocation and set to recur if needed
- Click details
- Add event type 'Resource allocaiton'
- Click privacy and select 'Members of this project can see this' then select the relevant project
- Select People and add the assignee)(s)
- Click 'Add event'

### Medium level planning - Support resource
Allocating support resource should be done on the first of every month. For each team member there is a monthly recurring task, which has a start date of 1st of the month and a due date on the last day of the month. It also has an estimation, which should reflect the average time spent on support tasks over the previous 2 months, by that staff member. The only thing you need to do is 1) Calculate the average time and 2) update the task estimation each month with the new average. This task will then spread the monthly resource (estimation) across the month in the planning sheet, so we can allocate resource around the support resource you have allocated.

- Go to Teamwork > Time > All time > Filter to show the date range for the previous 2 months > Export the data to an excel file
- Import the excel file into a Google sheet
- Add a pivot table; Rows = Task, Columns = Task list, Value = Decimal hours, Filter = Staff member
- Using the filter, select the first team member
- Sense check the tasks in the pivot table to ensure they are in the correct task list. If they arent, you can edit the task list in the overview sheet which will move the data to the support column on the pivot table.
- Once you are happy that the tasks are in the correct task list you can take the total time logged in the 'Support' task list and divide the number by 2, giving you the monthly average for that team member.
- Repeat the process for each team member
- Go to the project 'ZERO-1 Operations'
- Select the task list 'Support resource'
- Update the estimation on each team members task with their new monthly average and check the task dates are from the 1st to last date of the new month


### Low level planning
This is where you can schedule tasks in for the retainers, based on the number of hours of resource you have left after projects and support resource has been allocated. If you get a particularly large development on an MC, you can add this to the high level planning document to ensure your resource allocation is spread across the number of weeks required.There is a cyclical process that should allow you to carry out when doing low level task scheduling, which consists of: 

- Incoming requests being scoped and estimated by the team
- Your task prioritisation calls with the client
- Your time use management processes

Teamwork > Planning > workload. This will give you a visual representation of the allocation for each team member. All tasks actually scheduled will show on this page, along with annual leave, R&D allocations & Project resource allocations. 

# Processes
**[TASK FLOW FROM CREATION TO COMPLETION (INCLUDING TASK LIST/BOARD DEFAULTS & TRIGGERS)]**
(https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1k_64U2DcPi1jCrdBwAU3k4RDoaBUgmIXlcuCdybWgNU/edit)

**Estimate**
- This list is managed by the teams assigned
- Tasks are ordered top to bottom by date created
- The team should self manage their time to ensure tasks assigned to them are estimated
- When estimating a task the assignee should:
1. Assign the task to themselves
2. Start their timer
3. Review the requirements provided and if necessary, communicate with the client to ensure they understand what is required
4. Assess whether this is a straightforward piece of work that will only require input form them. If it is, the assignee should edit the task to add their estimation and move the task to the prioritise column. 
5. If the request requires input from multiple teams, they should discuss the work with the a member of the relevant team and create subtasks (one for each team member - time should not be logged under the parent task). Once all the subtasks are estimated, the parent task should be moved to the Prioritise column
6. If the request is an Epic (a group of requirements that require a much wider conversation, the assignee should add an Epic tag, which will create a new task list and a task template list, which the PM will then pick up
7. If the request is actually a support ticket and has been incorrectly categorised, the assignee should move the task to the support task list (not the support column) 

**Prioritise**
- This list is managed by the Account Manager and the Project Manager
- ALL TASKS SHOULD HAVE AN ESTIMATION
- Tasks are ordered manually with the highest priority tasks at the top of the column
- The Project Manager will:
1. Discuss priorities with the client during the regular catch up call and shoudl re-order the column accordingly.
2. Once the list is in good order, the PM will look at time available (using the Scrum Master doc) and the resources resources available using workload planner.
3. If time and resources are available the Project Manager will add a start and due to the task and will move the task to Ready to do column.

**Ready to do**
- This list is managed by the PM and the team
- ALL TASKS SHOULD BE ESTIMATED AND HAVE A START AD DUE DATE
- When the start date arrives an automation will be triggered to move the task to the not started column

**Not started**
- This list is managed by the task assignee
- ALL TASKS SHOULD BE ESTIMATED AND HAVE A START AND DUE DATE
- When the assignee starts the work they should start their timer and move the task to the In progress column
- This is work that we have committed to and the assignee is responsible from here for managing client expectations on the estimation, time used and delivery of the work

**In progress**
- This list is managed by the task assignee
- ALL TASKS SHOULD BE ESTIMATED AND HAVE A START AND DUE DATE
- When the assignee has completed their last task (or moved it onto QA) they should move the next task from the Not started column and start their  start their timer and move the task to the In progress column
- If the assignee has an impediment, they should detail their impediment in the task comments and add an Impediment tag
- If the assignee needs something from the client, they should communicate with the client in the task comments and add an Awaiting client tag
- This is work that we have committed to and the assignee is responsible from here for managing client expectations on the estimation, time used and delivery of the work
- Every time a timer is stopped the assignee should update the task comments with details of what they did during the time logged, what the next steps are and they should update the progress slider
- Once they are ready to hand the work to QA they should re-assign the task to the QA team and then move onto the next task
- If for any reason the task needs input from another team member a subtask should be created. If it is a bug, the subtask should be tagged with BUG, if it is a change the subtask should be created, assigned and then moved to the estimate column (TASKS SHOULD NEVER PASS BETWEEN TEAM MEMBERS UNLESS THE WORK IS DONE AND IT IS REASSIGNED TO QA)
- If a task fails QA, the QA assignee should add a failed testing tag and reassign the task back to the original assignee

**Support**
- This list is managed by the support team
- All tasks added will inherit a start date of today
- This list is ordered by start date - oldest at the top
- All tasks will be automatically assigned to 1st line when it is added to the support column. Anyone can change this.
- Support tickets can be reassigned between support team members
- All fixes should be approved by the clint and passed to QA to release, other than S1 tickets which require an immediate deployment by the developer

**Ready for release**
- This list is managed by the QA team
- Tasks can be reassigned by anyone if the deployment needs to be done by a specific developer
- Tasks will be ordered by due date

**Done**
- All tasks moved here will autoclose and be archived

**Permitted task tags (ALL PROJECT CATEGORIES)**
- Awaiting client
- Impediment
- Chased?
- Escalated
- On Hold
- Bug?
- Failed testing
- Disputed? - could these not be detailed in project risks? 
- Dispute approved? could these not be detailed in project risks? 
- Discpute declined? could these not be detailed in project risks?
- R&D


Face to face meetings (Minutes) (ALL PROJECT CATEGORIES)**
First go to this master copy document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w0xNR5W7kEsk7YW22FAOfSPed6DlJrAVV-NQytCWUC0/edit
ALWAYS click into the document and make a copy
Name the actual document to this format. YYYY_MM_DD then the title of the document - for example 2020_02_17 Divine Trash M2 Meeting Minutes. Date formatting means this can be easily ordered by date
Amend the following fields -
- Author
- Date
- Filename
- Client
- Project = This is typically the overview tab found in Teamwork
- Add Z1 attendees and client attendees
- Agreed Agenda - This can be found in the meeting calendar or be agreed before the meeting
Once the document has been created - paste the link in the relevant project (or pitch) under the tab Link OR n/a if internal and no project
An app is available on Arron's Ipad - this records the meeting and records a transcript. Enure that you have asked Arron that this can be done. An audio recording of the meeting minutes is VERY vaulable if you happen to miss something, which can be easily done when conversations are flowing.
Ideally using a laptop to record the discussions is the best way to detail what's been discussed in the meeting - this can then be added straight onto the document you have created. If a laptop isn't available, recording with a pad and pen and then transferring this to the document. This needs to be done as close to the meeting as possible
Recording the actions - example - Digital River Testing @kelly [today] [tomorrow] {Email John to see if they have a process for putting this live} !!!
NB this is the key for automated task generation/allocation etc
TASK TITLE @asignee [deadline] {task description}
NB. Once the meeting minutes are complete, please distribute to all attendees asking for any feedback or amendments, if none received, 1 business day after add the actions as tasks into Teamwork under the relevant departments. All tasks added that have come from actions have this within the start of the title - example - 2020_02_17 Create Shipping Table
THE FORMATTING OF THE ABOVE MUST MATCH WHAT TEAMWORK IS ABLE TO TAKE AND CREATE THE TASKS AUTOMATICALLY
DELETE THIS from the master copy BEFORE DISTRIBUTING
Next Meeting Agenda - Detail when we are next due to meet (if applicable) and what the agreed agenda items will be. These could be future tasks which we do NOT want to be actionable from THIS meeting. It could also be to review the completion of the actionable tasks above.






**SOPS** 
Are very simple Operations Tasks (SOPS) that they will carry out immediately. 

**Question** 
The Solutions Specialist will assign the task to the team best suited to anwer the question and will add a tag 'Question'. This moves the task to the 'Cards' task list and adds it to the 'Estimate' column.

**Support**
The Solutions Specialist will add a tag 'Support'. This will move the ticket to the support task list, which determines whether the ticket goes into the prioritise column, or straight out to 1st line (depending on which process the client chose during onboarding). 

**Change request**
The Solutions Specialist will assign the task to the team best suited to scope the request and will add a tag 'change request'. This will be reviewed, scoped and estimated by the assignee. Once the task has been estimated it should be moved to the prioritise column.

**Client catch up calls**
You will hold regular catch up calls with the Product Owner - See project governance. 

* NoteTry to hold all catch up calls for 10 hour projects on the same day, 20 hours on another day etc. This should allow you to reserve some time in your work schedule for working on other improtant aspects such as resource planning, reporting metrics etc

**Call Objectives**
- Discuss client priorities and order tasks in the prioritise column
- Review time available - see Managing time use
- Assess how many priority tasks can be achieved with the time available and discuss whether the client would like to invoice off some time or borrow time - see Managing time use
- Check whether you have the resources available to deliver the priority tasks - See Managing resources
- Agree what can be delivered, by whom and when
- Add start and due dates to the agreed tasks, ensure they have an assignee and then move the selected tasks into the ready to do column
- Discuss any upcoming milestones/Key business events and if necessary, add any key deliverables to the workload schedule so that we can bear them in mind for future scheduling

Although all calls are recorded, you should also add a summary in the Project Managment of: 
- Key points discussed
- Actions required before the next meeting and by whom
