# Quarterly Magento code audit 

## Pitch / Email

We highly recommend you have a quarterly code audit performed against your Magento installation.
 
The aim of this audit is to address issues before they become threatening to your sites performance or security.
 
This work will require approximately 4 hours to complete and you will receive a report at the end of the process detailing any recommendations. If after 4 hours there are still elements of the code base that need to be explored we will contact you to confirm you are happy to proceed.
 

## Instructions
 

Method : Compare core code to clean Magento code (SAK Use to do this!). Check module code performance. Check site with caches disabled for slow code/queries. Clean up GIT repo.
