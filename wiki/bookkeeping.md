Bookkeeping Queries

MAP send over a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EawNMvBp5xYVsJBPbJMkiV1q7H4LEno-5y6bQLvaHGQ/edit?gid=1320307630#gid=1320307630) once a week with a list of expenses that need supporting invoices to match the expense

I work from top to bottom and try and locate the invoices as per the Payee field column B

For example - H3G, I know this to be Arron's mobile phone. I know these invoices need to be obtain from logging into Arron's account and a good chunk of Arron's invoices are found in accounts that require 2FA, please see this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f0neWSkXN4qwS8zBUOYJN_Twvg-XP9OAw1Trlfddx4c/edit?gid=0#gid=0) for further information on which require 2FA. The ones that need 2FA are ones that need Arron to provide a code to get into the account.

I have shared all my passwords with Suze accordingly and they will be saved in her password vault

Once you have located the invoice - I send this to [DEXT Prepare](https://app.dext.com/login/) an invoicing processing portal. You will need a login to use this tool. You can either upload invoices directly by dragging and dropping them via the 'add document' section in the dashboard or send them to a personalised email which will automatically drop them into the DEXT dashboard, the personalised email can be found when you select add document. Once clicked you can see an email against single or multiply. Use which one fits best.

See screenshot - you want to be working within this area in DEXT -

Once your in the area thats correct - you should have a list of invoices awaiting to be processed. If at any point you have a duplicate as some get pulled in automatically (this can be limited as DEXT can't auto fetch invoices from supplier account dashboards that require 2FA to login) you can just archive them from the list. This helps not to delete them but removes them from the dashboard. MAP suggested this way to remove them

Click into the invoice you want to process and ensure the correct fields are populated - 

* Supplier

* Category - this is the nominal to post the expense to in XERO - if your not fully sure - check the latest old invoice in XERO under the suppliers contact and see what the last invoice nominal code was

* The currency will be auto populated via DEXT but ensure this is correct

* To note - MAP like a brief description of what the invoice is

* Check the tax is as it should be

* Payment method - I usually leave this blank and let MAP reconcile

* Publish to - Always purchases for invoices

* Publish as - this is mainly as awating payment. Sometimes if the invoice has already been paid via the Barclays Current account or VCC a payment that matches will flag up under the title Payment. If you are 100% sure this is the payment I usually mark this as paid.

* Once you have processed the invoice through DEXT - it will load for a short while and then pop up with a link to view bill in DEXT. Click this and it will take you to the bill as it was being configured for processing and you can then see a link that will say Open in XERO. Click the link and view this in XERO. Copy the url from XERO and add a link in the expenses spreadsheet in the correct row for the expense so MAP can tally up and reconcile if required.

Cash Coding invoices - this means a monthly recurring invoice that is the same amount each month and can just be cash coded against a previous invoice - for an example of this in [XERO is Audible](https://go.xero.com/app/!wQ9!Z/contacts/contact/32cb2993-21f9-4885-a496-05e59f503ffc/activity/spend-money?pageNumber=1&pageSize=25&searchTerm=&sortByDirection=DESC&sortByField=InvoiceDate&startDate=&endDate=). So you can just put a link from the latest cash coded invoice in XERO into the expenses spreadsheet as per the screenshot here -

Sending Bank Statements to MAP once a month

MAP need the Barclays Current Account and Savings Account statements sent over once a month. These are released in Barclays Online Banking the 17th of each month. Gain access into [Barclays Bank Online](https://bank.barclays.co.uk/olb/authlogin/loginAppContainer.do#/identification) I use Suzanne's log in details to obtain access. 

Once you have downloaded the Statements - send these via email with the latest VCC statement to you key contact at MAP.
