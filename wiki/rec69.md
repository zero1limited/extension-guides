Google LCP Score (Largest Contentful Paint)

The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) reports the time it takes for the largest element within the viewport to be rendered. In the same category as First Contentful Paint, LCP is a user-centric metric that displays the perceived load speed of the main content on the page.

If a website doesn’t reveal the main content fast, visitors are more likely to close the page and go to a competitor’s website. SEO algorithms change over time, but historically, this type of behavior hasn’t been favored either by search engines or by visitors themselves.

Google uses tools which inspects your LCP speed and then generates a score and it does this on a page-by-page basis for both desktop and mobile. 

Having a good LCP score usually means that your visitors won’t have problems getting relevant information without waiting too much. Please note that not all websites may have the main content in the biggest block inside the viewport, but that’s a very common case.

Once you've gone into Google Search Console, get a report of what pages have the most errors and on what devices. Make a judgment call on which page / device you're gonna work on and let the client know. Ideally, the more focussed the better.

Eg. 

Hi Client,
Having just reviewed your web vitals I feel we should concentrate on your product list pages having received low scores. blah.

You obviously get a score for FCP on the Lighthouse report (red, yellow, green). Quickest way is to look at that once you've made your changes to see what difference it's made.

The more substantial way is Google Search Console. In there, you'll find errors / warnings about FCP. You can ask Google to rescan the site once your changes are live to confirm in there that the errors / warnings are gone.
Not 100% sure how to do that but Max can help.
