Chase aged receivables how to - 

Once a week is the best time frame to chasing aged receivables - this means chasing overdue invoices awaiting payment to ZERO-1

1 - Login to XERO

2 - Click Dashboard

3 - Click on Reconcile on the Barclays Current Account

4 - Reconcile any bills that you can 100% see have a payment allocated to it - this ensures that we're not chasing any old invoices off clients that could of already potentially paid. By doing this first, this will make sure we are not doing that.

5 - Once invoices are reconciled - Click Business > Invoices > Awaiting Payments

6 - Go through the list one by one of invoices that are overdue. Any your not sure about consult with Suzanne

7 - Once you start on the first one, click into it and check the history and notes section - you are confirming if any RL1 or RL2 emails have been sent. If no RL's have been sent you will send an RL1, if RL1 has already been sent you will be sending a RL2

Send RL1 as the first chaser - select RL1 from the drop down and send email

Once its confirmed RL1 has sent - go back to the invoice view page of the invoice you have to just sent a reminder on and add in the notes area RL1 sent

If RL1 has been sent the previous week you would follow this process and send an email for RL2 and then state in the notes on the invoice view page RL2 has been sent

If RL2 has been sent for an invoice the previous week - this time a phone call to the accounts department of the invoice you are chasing happens. Hopefully they will give you a payment date for the invoice you are chasing. Detail in the invoice notes that you have called and add a expected payment date on the invoice if they have given one

If the following week, their payment hasn't yet come in - consult with Suzanne and what to do next
