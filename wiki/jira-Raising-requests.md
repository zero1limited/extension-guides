# Work requests
All requests will land in the Jira Service Management application. 

## Customer requests
Each retainer project has 3 different issue types, which can only be raised by the client using the following methods: 
- Change request - Rasied via their portal
- Support - Raised via their portal
- Critical Support - Email only (ac@zero1commerce.atlassian.net) - IS THIS THE CORRECT EMAIL ADDRESS?

## ZERO-1 Rasied
How do we raise requests and how do we get approval for recommendations?
