## If the client has spotted the issue and has raised a new ticket: 
1. The ticket should be tagged as an S1
2. The original ticket should be re-opened and added as a subtask (go to list view, click on the subtask icon on the new ticket, then drag the original ticket under the new ticket to link it)
3. Add the original assignee to the parent task 
4. Confirm whether the work can be rolled back
