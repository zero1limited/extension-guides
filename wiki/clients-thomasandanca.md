## Support Process
T&A are on a BAU (Business as usual) contract, so they only have 2 hours a month of allocated senior time (2nd line and above). Kelly is also overseeing the project, so if you have any concerns regarding time etc, please speak to her about it.

A majority of tasks that come in are actionable in 1st line. In cases of escalation, let Kelly know in Slack and check how much time is available before escalation, so it can
then be dealt with in line with the process.

Regarding live access, speak to Reuben, he should be able to create an account. This would be used in scenarios where a task can be resolved with no issues on the 
live admin (post-release changes, CMS changes payment config etc)

All time on T&A is non-billable and is only billed when a senior member of the team (2nd line and above) is working on the task. There is no limit on time other than senior time, which 
is why escalation for T&A is usually a last resort.

In cases where they have no senior time, the task would need to wait until time is available. Speak to Suz/Kel for more info or if you are unsure


## Payments 
T&A use SagePay/Opayo = the config can be found in the Testing Payments guide.

## Emails
T&A has recently had issues with emails. Recaptcha was initially set to Off, which causes a spamming wave to occur. This has been rectified, but in the event, this reoccurs in the
future:
<ul>
  <li>Check Recaptcha to ensure it still is enabled/functioning</li>
  <li>Check the Logs to see if there is an issue with the SMTP</li>
</ul>

## Facebook/Meta Integration
There have not been any reported issues since this was installed and set up, but if you need access to it, speak to Jenny and ask for her Facebook credentials, as the business page is on her account. 

The integration can be accessed in admin from the dashboard by going to the following: `Meta > Setup/` or `Meta > Configuration`.

**N.B: Make sure you are in a private/incognito window when trying to do the above. For some reason, the configuration menu is cached and won't show unless in incognito.**
