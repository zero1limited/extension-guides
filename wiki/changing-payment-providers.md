# Changing Payment Providers
[TOC]



## Estimating
Key questions for estimating requirements are:

 - What Payment methods are required? e.g.
   - Debit/Credit card
   - ApplePay
   - GooglePay
 - Which currencies are required?
 ## TODO
 - Add more bullet points on currency, what currency should transactions use e.g should transactions be coming through as base currency
   ## NEED to add more info here^^ 
 - Is your existing or new provider supporting any fast checkout methods from PDP or Minicart?
 - Do you need to keep the existing payment extension in place for any reason (Ie phased delivery, refund management etc)?
 - Do you intend to have methods restricted by country?
 - Do you have any back-office requirements related to payment methods that we need to be aware of?
 - Testing
   - Will there be a Sandbox/Development account?
   - Do you require us to carry out testing?
 - If multi-site
   - Is a phased (website)launch approach required?
   - Are there different credentials for different sites?
   - Do some payment methods only need to be used on specific sites






## Considerations
- Does a back office system need to be tested before go live?
  



## Best Practice Key Processes
 - Setup and configure payments on sandbox to ensure no issues are present before go live
