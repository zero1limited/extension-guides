There will be a message located on the top of the page in a banner stating perform year end. By clicking this you are just stating that any holidays from the previous year are all now complete
Once clicked, I always go into each staff member and ensure their holiday enetitlement is correct. The full time members usually have all their holiday enetitlment correct as it copies what was set up from the previous year.
You will need to confirm part time members have their holiday enetitlement calculated correctly as you will need to work out their allowance is correct and they havent changed their hours or days
Ensure that any bank holidays they would already be off for are deducted from their yearly allowance
