# New task received

## Task list, defaults & Automations
Client raised - requests are sent to support@zero1.co.uk 

### Default task list
All tasks raised via the support email address will be created in the project Inbox

### Default task list settings
- Following comments: Product owner
- Following changes & comments: Project Manager
- Tags: New

### Automations
When a task is added to the inbox it will trigger the 'New task' automation, which will add a comment to the task (notifying followers inc Product Owner & PM)

  "This request has been received and is currently being assessed"

## How to handle a new ticket
1. Read the task description
2. Is it a support ticket?
3. Yes > Add an S1 tag and follow the process for S1 tickets
4. No > Move the task to the 'Support' task list
5. Move the task to the prioritise column (this will trigger an automated update to the client "This task has been assessed and is ready to be discussed during your next prioritisation call with your Project Manager". If this is a business critical task please ask your Project Manager if it can be expedited.

# Discussion required
- Should it be the PM that handles new tickets?
- What if an S1 is raised after the PM has finished? Who gets notified?  
- At what point does the PM get removed from the task? When it is in the prioritise column? when it has been moved to Support, not started?
- Should the PM follow all backlog tasks and only be removed once it is in the hands of the wider team? A lot of backlog tasks have comments missed. TBD
