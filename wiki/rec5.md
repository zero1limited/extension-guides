# PHP Upgrade


We have noticed you web server is currently running an outdated PHP version therefore we recommend an upgrade.
 
PHP is the software that powers Magento and as well as added security, updating PHP can offer significant performance improvements. We estimate this work will take about 2 hours to complete provided thre are no software implications such as requirements to upgrade either Magento or intalled extensions.
 
If any issues with 3rd party modules are found we will try to resolve these with a best effort approach but it may require upgrades or contact with the developers. This work would be completed above and beyond this original task.

Typically we will propose this recommendation when we know your existing Magento version is compatible with the newer version we are proposing and this will be confirmed once you have approved the recommendation. In some cases this might be a minor (security patch) update which generally should be expedited.
