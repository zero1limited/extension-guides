Petty Cash Reconciliation how to - 

Once a month the Petty Cash tin thats located in the office needs balancing once a month

Add any receipts you have collected throughout the month. Add these to XERO one by one

For example its things like milk, teabags, postage

I usually take a picture of the receipt and email it to myself

Adding it to XERO under the Petty Cash Bank Account - [Link to XERO video adding a Petty Cash Receipt](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/HVYam9KzoYkiBpLNtiBRwc)

For a rule of thumb. Milk and coffee are NO VAT configuration and the nominal for this is Disbursments

Once all receipts are reconciled - the Balance amount in the video that's pointed out - this amount should match what's in your petty cash tin
