Google Merchant Centre allows you to place your products on the 1st page of Google via Google Adwords. We can create an optimised Feed which will generate daily and load your active inventory ready to display products via paid Ads. We will also setup a low priority campaign to display products with the lowest possible budgets.

This task requires that you purchase the Simple Google Product extension from Wyomind.
