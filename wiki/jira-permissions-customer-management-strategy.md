# Permissions - Customer Management Strategy

## Who will our customers be?
In Jira/JSM there are different customer types, Internal customers, external customers. Here is a summary of each type:
- **Internal Customers**: ZERO-1 staff who want to raise a request to ZERO-1 e.g 'My laptop has broken'
- **External Customers**: ZERO-1 Clients or collaborators

We have restricted Jira Service Management to External customers only. This is a [global configuration](https://zero1commerce.atlassian.net/jira/settings/products/servicedesk/customer-access) in Products > Customer access

This means that JSM customers:
- have portal-only accounts
- can access help centers
- can send requests from help centers or via email
- can view knowledge base articles in help centers
- do not access Atlassian products (no product licenses consumed)
- be configured to use SAML single sign-on to access our help centers.

## Customer Product Access
The access each client has to Jira products is determined by the following....

| PROJECT TYPE | RETAINER COMMITMENT | JIRA Cloud   | Jira Service Management|
|:-------------|:--------------------|:------------:|:----------------------:|
|Quoted Project|N/A                  |Y             |N                       |
|Retainer      |Below 49 hrs         |N             |Y                       |
|Reatiner      |50 hrs or above      |Y             |Y                       |
