To enable Apple Pay, you need to set up your Apple developer account and Xcode with three main steps: create a merchant identifier, a payment processing certificate, and enable Apple Pay within your app's Xcode settings. This process involves logging into your Apple Developer account, creating the necessary certificates, and then configuring your app in Xcode.
