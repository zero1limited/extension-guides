# Setup
Arron can now spin up a brand new dedicated server with OVH/SYS and with a script, this is a [separately defined recommendation here](https://wiki.zero1.co.uk/services/consultancy/shared-recommendations/gb107)

This is required to plug your PWA store into, the output of this is that it will provide an IP/Magento URL needed for the below installation process



# PWA Initialisation

Setting up for the first time we refer to the instructions to initially clone the project from Vue as per [this article but below for quick reference] (https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/installation/linux-mac.html)

create new folder locally for your project so in my example case I have created a folder called divinetrash and open a terminal cd into that folder.


```
mkdir pwa-divinetrash && cd pwa-divinetrash
git clone https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront.git vue-storefront
cd vue-storefront
yarn
yarn installer
```
Select your new backend instance as created Eg `http://176.31.117.54/`
