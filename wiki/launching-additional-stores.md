## Estimating
Key questions for estimating requirements are:

   - CMS Pages/Blocks
   - Categories
 - Will the store inherit the same pages/blocks or does it require duplicates?
 - Will the launch project require a temporary domain
 - Do we have Captcha in place and the relevant access to add new domain(s)?
 - Will the pre-launch phase require site access restrictions?
 - Detail all 3rd party services
 - Will the site inherit the same GTM setup?
 - If new accounts are required for 3rd parties, will you be setting these up or do you wish us to handle this? Please list all accounts and confirm
 - Email Templates
   -  Will they share existing templates?
   -  How many templates are required?
   -  Will new sending email domains be required?
