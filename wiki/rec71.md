Google Accessibility Score

Digital accessibility is ensuring your website can be accessed by everyone regardless of barriers and disabilities. Ensuring you have good accessiblity on your site is essentially making sure you haven’t excluded people with visual, hearing, motor or cognitive impairments from your content.

Google uses tools which inspects the accessibility of your site and provides examples of any elements on your site that aren't accessible to all users. It does this on a page-by-page basis for both desktop and mobile.

Improving your site's accessibility is very important as it ensures all of your users have the same experience regardless of barriers and/or disabilities.

We will shortly follow up on this ticket to provide more information based on the assessments we have made along with the current data and and indication of the improvements we hope to make in the time provided.

# Follow up Email

Once you've gone into Google Search Console, get a report of what pages have the most errors and on what devices. Make a judgment call on which page / device you're gonna work on and let the client know. Ideally, the more focussed the better.

Eg.

Hi Client,
Having just reviewed your web vitals I feel we should concentrate on your product list pages having received low scores. blah.

# Testing

You obviously get a score for accessibility on the Lighthouse report (red, yellow, green). Quickest way is to look at that once you've made your changes to see what difference it's made.

The more substantial way is Google Search Console. In there, you'll find errors / warnings about accessibility. You can ask Google to rescan the site once your changes are live to confirm in there that the errors / warnings are gone.
