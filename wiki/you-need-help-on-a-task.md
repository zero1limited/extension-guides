If you have a task/ticket that needs the input of another team member you should consider whether it is;
- A question that you need to ask of another team member
- It needs to be reassigned
  
## Quick Question
You should slack or call the team member to ask the question. Please do not reassign the task or add any assignees to the task. It should remain your responsibility. If the team member doesnt reply straight away then you should ask them when they will be free to discuss it. Arrange a meeting if you have to. 

## It needs to be reassigned
You can simply add a tag 'Escalated' to the task. This will reassign the task back to the project manager who will reallocate and resource the work accordingly.
