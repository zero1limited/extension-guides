# Configuration

We appreciate feedback (including bugs or installation issues) via our new [community Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/openpos-workspace/shared_invite/zt-32ozggysy-s1XeL_IcChy6PLLNmtUMeg). 

Configuration can be found in:
[Stores] -> [Configuration] -> [OpenPOS] -> [Configuration]

Once the module is installed, you can run `bin/magento openpos:setup-wizard` for guided setup of the POS store.


> [!TIP]
> Incase you didn't already know, OpenPOS is built to run as a standard Magento website, therefore you need to perform all relevant domain and webserver configuration to ensure the site resolves and is externally accessible.


# Theme Association
As part of any traditional Hyv√§ Theme setup you might want to copy our base POS theme into app/design and inherit `openpos/default`
If you are using our default template simply set your POS website theme to 'OpenPOS Default'
